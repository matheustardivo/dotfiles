## Install instructions
(TODO: I need to create a new install script, and maybe think about create symlinks instead of copying files)

Just run `./install.sh`

This will copy all the files in `files` folder to the appropriate locations

## Configuration
You should change the files `~/.bashrc` and `~/.gitconfig` to your settings.
